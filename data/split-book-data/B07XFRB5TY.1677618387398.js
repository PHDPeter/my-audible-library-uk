window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>At last, the definitive audiobook about perhaps the best cabin crew dramedy ever filmed: <i>View from the Top</i> starring Gwyneth Paltrow.&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>Ayoade on Top</i>, Richard Ayoade, perhaps one of the most 'insubstantial' people of our age, takes us on a journey from Peckham to Paris by way of Nevada and other places we don't care about. It's a journey deep within, in a way that's respectful and non-invasive; a journey for which we will all pay a heavy price, even if you've waited for the smaller paperback edition.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ayoade argues for the canonisation of this brutal masterpiece, a film that celebrates capitalism in all its victimless glory; one we might imagine Donald Trump himself half-watching on his private jet's gold-plated flat screen while his other puffy eye scans the cabin for fresh, young prey.</p>";

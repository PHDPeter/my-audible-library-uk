James and Charles Dickens, will keep you on the edge of your seat and leave you with a lingering sense of foreboding. </p><p>In \"The Tractate Middoth\", librarian David Garrett has a terrifying encounter while searching for an obscure book, while in \"Mr Testator's Visitation\", a poor man 'borrows' some furniture from another man's cellar, never expecting the owner to return and claim it. Then, late one night, there is a knock upon his door.... </p><p>\"Casting the Runes\" tells the story of a don who rejects an alchemist's manuscript - only to find that the man's knowledge of black magic goes beyond the purely theoretical. </p><p>Finally, in \"The Trial for Murder\", a banker has an alarming experience when he is foreman of the jury in a murder case.</p>";

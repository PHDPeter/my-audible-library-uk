As the FBI agents investigating the X-Files - strange and inexplicable cases the bureau wants to keep hidden - Mulder and Scully are determined to track down the forces they suspect are behind the murders. </p> <p>While the police hunt the fleeing professor, Mulder and Scully track the skin that was grafted onto him, a trail that leads from the morgue to the headquarters of a cutting-edge biotech company to the jungles of Thailand.

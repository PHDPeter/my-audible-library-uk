window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>The Atlas Six</i></b><b> by Olivie Blake is the runaway TikTok must-listen fantasy novel of the year, read by a full cast of narrators. If you loved </b><b><i>Ninth House</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>A Deadly Education</i></b><b>, you’ll love this.</b></p> <p><b>Secrets. Betrayal. Seduction.</b></p> <p><b>Welcome to the Alexandrian Society.</b></p> <p>When the world’s best magicians are offered an extraordinary opportunity, saying yes is easy. Each could join the secretive Alexandrian Society, whose custodians guard lost knowledge from ancient civilizations. Their members enjoy a lifetime of power and prestige. Yet each decade, only six practitioners are invited—to fill five places.</p> <p>Contenders Libby Rhodes and Nico de Varona are inseparable enemies, cosmologists who can control matter with their minds. Parisa Kamali is a telepath, who sees the mind’s deepest secrets. Reina Mori is a naturalist who can perceive and understand the flow of life itself. And Callum Nova is an empath, who can manipulate the desires of others. Finally there’s Tristan Caine, whose powers mystify even himself.</p> <p>Following recruitment by the mysterious Atlas Blakely, they travel to the Society’s London headquarters. Here, each must study and innovate within esoteric subject areas. And if they can prove themselves, over the course of a year, they’ll survive. Most of them.</p> <p><b>The story continues in </b><b><i>The Atlas Paradox, </i></b><b>the heart-stopping sequel.</b></p> <p><b>Originally a self-published sensation, this edition has been fully edited and revised. Now includes the short story Sacred Hospitality.</b></p>";

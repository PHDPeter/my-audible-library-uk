window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A beguiling new episode from the universe of <i>His Dark Materials</i>.</b></p> <p>Lyra's Oxford opens two years after the conclusion of Philip Pullman's <i>The Amber Spyglass</i> in the comfort and familiarity of Jordan College, where Lyra and her daemon, Pantalaimon, sit on the sun-drenched roof looking out over all of Oxford. But their peace is shattered when a strange bird - a witch's daemon, on it's own - tumbles out of the sky, in search of a healing elixer to cure his witch of a strange new disease. Lyra and Pan decided to help - witches are friends, of course - but the closer their winding walk leads them towards the infamous Oxford alchemist, the stronger Lyra's sense that something is amiss.</p>";

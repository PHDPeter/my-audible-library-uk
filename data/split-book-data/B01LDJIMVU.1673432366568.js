window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>AUDIBLE DEBUTS CHILLING NEW SCI-FI FROM BERLIN INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL WINNER IVAR LEON MENGER. </p> <p>Callum Blue (<i>Dead Like Me</i>), Anastasia Griffith (<i>Damages</i>) and Marc Warren (<i>Hustle</i>) star in new audio-drama from Germany's master of thriller. </p> <p>Catalysing the surge of interest in classic 70s and 80s sci-fi thrillers, and just in time for Halloween, Audible today exclusively debuts Monster 1983, an original audio-drama from Berlinale-winning director Ivan Leon Menger. Directed by multiple-Audie and RPA winner Cherry Cookson, the chilling tale stars Callum Blue (Dead Like Me), Anastasia Griffith (Damages) and Marc Warren (Hustle) amongst others. </p> <p>Drawing influences from <i>Poltergeist</i>, <i>Stand By Me</i> and <i>E.T.</i> and other Spielberg classics, the story unfolds in the small coastal town of Harmony Bay, Oregon. Still reeling from a sudden and profound family tragedy, Sheriff Cody uproots his elder son Michael, and younger daughter Amy, from the chaos of Orlando to begin a new, more relaxed life in the Beaver State. Soon after their arrival however, this new-found tranquillity is disturbed by a succession of brutal but mysterious deaths. As the plot twists and turns its way through small-town secrecy, psychiatry wards and the supernatural, Cody comes under increasing pressure to solve each new case whilst keeping his family safe from harm. </p> <p>Ivar Leon Menger, author of Monster 1983, said: 'Having been raised on Spielberg, King and Kubrick I can't remember a time in my life when I wasn't watching some kind of horror, sci-fi or psychological thriller. I think the legacy of 70s and 80s horror cinema runs quite strongly through Monster 1983, and that's part of the reason I decided to create an audio-only story, it emphasises both the nostalgia and suspense for listeners.' </p> <p>Steve Carsey, Director of Original Programming at Audible, said: 'After the enormous success of Alien, Out of the Shadows we knew there was a huge appetite for compelling sci-fi audio fiction. Ivar's stories have been immensely successful in Germany so we're really excited to introduce his work to UK listeners.' </p> <p><i>Monster 1983</i> is a Wireless Theatre production for Audible Studios. Written by Ivar Leon Menger, translated by Guy Meredith and directed by Cherry Cookson with music scoring by Ynie Ray. </p> <p><i>Monster 1983</i> Cast:</p> <p>Callum Blue (Sheriff Cody), Anastasia Griffith (Deputy Taylor Dunford), Marc Warren (Deputy Landers), Rachel Atkins, Barbara Barnes, Andrea Browne, Nicholas Boulton, Philip Bulcock, Sophie Cartman, Amy Cash, Lobo Chan, Charlotte Christie, Trevor Cuthbertson, Stephen Critchlow, Sean Delaney, Jessica Dennis,Tom Gregory, Adam Hall, Will Howard, Gerran Howell, Nicky Henson, Madeleine Kasson, Lorelei King, Stuart Milligan, Harry Myers, Nathan Osgood, Chris Rogers, Martin T Sherman, Thomas Stroppell and Trevor White. </p>";

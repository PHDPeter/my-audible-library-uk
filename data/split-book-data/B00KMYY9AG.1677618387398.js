window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Two years have passed since the dramatic destruction of Count Dracula. And Jonathan Harker has settled down to a quiet life as a junior partner in a law firm. But his reputation is about to catch up with him. </p><p>As word of his abilities spreads, clients are turning to him for help with problems which appear to have an involvement in the supernatural. His first case takes him to Cornwall, where the Haywood family are worried about the imminent marriage of their daughter, Flora, to the elusive Sir Owen Velland. </p><p>Flora had been engaged for two years to the amiable Doctor Goodwin, before suddenly breaking off the relationship in favour of Sir Owen. Yet Sir Owen had been recently widowed under very suspicious circumstances and rumours are circulating in the small Cornish town that his unnatural powers and abilities may have some involvement with devil worship. </p><p>Are these rumours just idle gossip? Or is there a dark truth behind what people are saying? Can Harker use his knowledge of unusual and the occult to befriend Sir Owen and discover his secrets? Or has he come up against an opponent even deadlier than Dracula himself? </p><p><i>Devil May Care</i> sees the return of Jonathan Harker, the hero of Bram Stoker's classic <i>Dracula</i>, in a chilling new historical mystery series. Tony Evans is a full-time writer. His other publications include the Hester Lynton Mystery series and adaptations of classic novels [for the “Real Reads” series]. He lives with his wife in the Yorkshire Dales.</p>";

window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"I think the reason we're so struck by [<i>Jane Eyre</i>] is how Charlotte Brontë manages to relate, expertly, what it means to be a human being...and that never changes.\" (Narrator Thandiwe Newton)&nbsp;</p> <p>Following Jane from her childhood as an orphan in Northern England through her experience as a governess at Thornfield Hall, Charlotte Brontë's Gothic classic is an early exploration of women's independence in the mid-19th century and the pervasive societal challenges women had to endure. At Thornfield, Jane meets the complex and mysterious Mr. Rochester, with whom she shares a complicated relationship that ultimately forces her to reconcile the conflicting passions of romantic love and religious piety. Performing the early Victorian novel with great care and respect, actress Thandiwe Newton (<i>Crash</i>, <i>The Pursuit of Happyness</i>) draws out <i>Jane Eyre</i>'s intimacy and depth while conveying how truly progressive Brontë was in an era of extreme restraint.&nbsp;</p>";

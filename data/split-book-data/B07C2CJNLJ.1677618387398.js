window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Powers of Darkness</i> is an incredible literary discovery. In 1900, Icelandic publisher and writer Valdimar Asmundsson set out to translate Bram Stoker's world-famous 1897 novel <i>Dracula</i>.&nbsp;</p> <p>Called <i>Makt Myrkranna</i> (literally, 'Powers of Darkness'), this Icelandic edition included an original preface written by Stoker himself. <i>Makt Myrkranna</i> was published in Iceland in 1901 but remained undiscovered outside of the country until 1986, when Dracula scholarship was astonished by the discovery of Stoker's preface to the book.&nbsp;</p> <p>However, no one looked beyond the preface and deeper into Asmundsson's story. In 2014, literary researcher Hans de Roos dove into the full text of <i>Makt Myrkranna</i>, only to discover that Asmundsson hadn't merely translated Dracula but had penned an entirely new version of the story, with all new characters and a totally reworked plot. The resulting narrative is one that is shorter, punchier, more erotic, and perhaps even more suspenseful than Stoker's <i>Dracula</i>.&nbsp;</p> <p>Incredibly, <i>Makt Myrkranna</i> has never been translated or even read outside of Iceland until now. <i>Powers of Darkness</i> presents the first ever translation into English of Stoker and Asmundsson's <i>Makt Myrkranna</i>. With a foreword by Dacre Stoker, Bram Stoker's great-grandnephew and best-selling author, and an afterword by Dracula scholar John Edgar Browning, <i>Powers of Darkness</i> will amaze and entertain legions of fans of Gothic literature, horror, and vampire fiction.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying reference material will be available in your Library section along with the audio.</b></p>";

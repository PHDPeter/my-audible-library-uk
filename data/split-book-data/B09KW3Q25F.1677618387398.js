In fact, it’s at the heart of our survival - both as a species and as individuals. This makes America’s current loneliness epidemic all the more concerning.&nbsp;</p> <p>But the truth is that it’s hard to make friends. So many of us yearn for belonging but fear the icy sting of rejection, the long dark night of isolation. All of us deserve a place to belong, whether we’re completely friendless or we feel lonely in crowds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>And that connection is possible. Kyler Shumway, CEO of Deep Eddy Psychotherapy, knows this firsthand. His own success story with friendship stems from a lifeline of loneliness, rejection, and heartache. And in his inspiring Audible Original, <i>The Science of Friendship</i>, he offers you insights into what friendship is, how it works, and how to cultivate more rewarding connections in your own life - regardless of how lonely you may or may not feel. How does interpersonal connection work on a neuroscientific level? What schemas do we live under that keep us unconnected from one another? Why do some friendships evolve into romantic relationships or even become toxic?&nbsp;</p> <p>At its core, Shumway’s lessons are a rewarding, life-affirming look at how to make our disconnected world just a bit more connected. With his help, you can learn to become a good friend to your community, to those around you, and (most important) to yourself.</p>";

window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Bloomsbury presents <i>Mischief Acts</i> by Zoe Gilbert, read by James Goode, Jilly Bond, Kit Griffiths, Sean Barrett and Sharon Eckman.</p> <p>Herne - the hunter, mischief-maker, spirit of the forest, leader of the wild hunt - hurtles through the centuries pursued by his creator.</p> <p>A shape-shifter, Herne dons many guises as he slips and ripples through time - at candlelit <i>Twelfth Night </i>revels, at the spectacular burning of the Crystal Palace, at an acid-laced '60s party. Wherever he goes, transgression, debauch and enchantment always follow in his wake.</p> <p>But as the forest is increasingly encroached upon by urban sprawl and gentrification and the world slides into crisis, Herne must find a way to survive - or exact his revenge.</p> <p>With its intoxicating chameleonic voice and boundless imagination, <i>Mischief Acts </i>is British folklore as youâ€™ve never heard it before: dangerous, sexy, troubling, daring, savage, an exhilarating race through time and space, weaving together the ancient and the contemporary.</p>";

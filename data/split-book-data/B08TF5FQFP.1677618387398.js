window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Emmy Award winner Matthew Rhys stars in this fascinating and award-winning one-man show about international star of stage and screen Richard Burton. Written by Mark Jenkins, <i>Playing Burton </i>offers a penetrating look at the notorious actorâ€™s life, from growing up in an impoverished mining community in South Wales to becoming one of the greatest performers of his generation. Following his passionate, though tempestuous, love affair with Elizabeth Taylor and his tragic - and very public - battle with alcoholism, <i>Playing Burton </i>is a soulful exploration of fame, ambition, and identity told from the perspective of the megastar who experienced it all.</p> <p><b>Please note</b>: <i>Playing Burton </i>contains adult language and themes.&nbsp;</p>";

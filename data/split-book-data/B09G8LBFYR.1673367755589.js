window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From critically acclaimed author Troy Onyango comes a dark, suspenseful tale of spirits bearing witness to a crime that rocks an island community, based on the Luo legend of the water people.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>When fishermen on Nam Lolwe (commonly known as Lake Victoria) return with the body of a young boy found inside the sack, a close-knit island is thrown into mourning, and they all suspect foul play in the death of the child. But who could have committed such a terrible crime, and why? To discover the truth, the islanders must rely on the water spirits beneath the lake’s surface - the only souls who serve as witnesses to the vile act.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";

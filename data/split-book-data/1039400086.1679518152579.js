window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Contains episodes one, two, and three of Claw &amp; Warder. </b></p> <p><i>Seduction</i>, Episode 1&nbsp;</p> <p>Leery Oriscoe is just a conflicted New York cop who got hit by the Hassidic bus - only the bus was driven by a werewolf. Thereâ€™s bound to be a little crazy under his black hat. His life just got 10 times more complicated. His new half-vampire and half-succubus partner is smart, sexy as hell, and keeping a big secret from everyone.</p> <p>Oh, and their lieutenant? She's the ghost of a Van Helsing. Their case? Tracking down the entity responsible for leaving the drained body of a young man in Riverside Park. With a succubus for a partner, another as a witness, and yet another as the prime suspect, will Leery end up the victim of the next seduction?</p> <p><i>Arms Dealers</i>, Episode 2&nbsp;</p> <p>She's an expert spellslinger. He's a grizzled detective with a wolfish side. Dru and Leery are a match for anything. Faced with a pair of armless bodies and an unlikely pair of criminal masterminds - a Norwegian wood troll and an Unseelie - Leery knows the right people to help sort it all out. There's only one hitch: the Zombie mafia. Full of danger and mystery, the case keeps everyone involved on edge. Leery even takes a break from drinking coffee. With the Zombie mafia's constant need for spare parts, is it any wonder the Locus of New York is full of arms dealers?</p> <p><i>Mitzvah</i>, Episode 3</p> <p>Everyone has a past, even Hassidic werewolves. Leery's past has a taste for blood and wants revenge. There's a killer running wild in the East Village, and according to the witness, it's Leery Oriscoe in wolf form. When Van Helsing puts him on a desk, Leery storms off, leaving Dru to prove his innocence. But to do it, she will need help from her mother, and that means a trip to Hell. It looks like Dru picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue. After another body drops, Leery is in the clear, but the Rabbi that turned him becomes the prime suspect. To make things worse, the Zombie mafia's pet necromancer assassin is in town, and she's gunning for Leery.</p>";

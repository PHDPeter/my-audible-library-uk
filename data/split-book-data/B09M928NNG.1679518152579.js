window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Francis Saxover and Diana Brackley, two scientists investigating a rare lichen, discover it has a remarkable property: it retards the aging process. Francis, realising the implications for the world of an ever-youthful, wealthy elite, wants to keep it secret, but Diana sees an opportunity to overturn the male status quo by using the lichen to inspire a feminist revolution.</p> <p>As each scientist wrestles with the implications and practicalities of exploiting the discovery, the world comes ever closer to learning the truth....</p> <p><i>Trouble with Lichen</i> is a scintillating story of the power wielded by science in our lives and asks, how much trust should we place in those we appoint to be its guardians?</p> <p>About the author: John Wyndham Parkes Lucas Benyon Harris was born in 1903, the son of a barrister. He tried a number of careers including farming, law, commercial art and advertising, and started writing short stories, intended for sale, in 1925. From 1930 to 1939 he wrote stories of various kinds under different names, almost exclusively for American publications, while also writing detective novels. During the war he was in the Civil Service and then the Army. In 1946 he went back to writing stories for publication in the USA and decided to try a modified form of science fiction, a form he called 'logical fantasy'.</p>";

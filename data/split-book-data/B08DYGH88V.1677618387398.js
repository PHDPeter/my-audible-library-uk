All Cole wants is to continue the love of magic that he and his late father shared by becoming the best tween magician in the Las Vegas area.&nbsp;</p> <p>But when Cole and his mother get a mysterious note from a rare book collector, he’s forced to search among his father’s belongings for <i>A Lesson in Magick</i>, an old book of spells connected to an ancient group of magickers. What he finds instead are a series of coded clues his dad left for him - clues that send Cole and his best friends Ethan and Sanchez on a wild scavenger hunt throughout Las Vegas, in search of <i>A Lesson in Magick</i>. Cole must use every hack and magic trick he’s got, because he knows that if the book falls into the wrong hands, disaster will strike.&nbsp;</p> <p>As danger mounts, who can this clever, funny, and determined group of friends really trust in a world filled with professional magicians, strange professors, and scary Elvis impersonators?</p>";

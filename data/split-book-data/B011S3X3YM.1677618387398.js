window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A tantalizing selection of stories from some of the best female authors who've helped define the modern vampire. Bram Stoker was hardly the first author - male or female - to fictionalize the folkloric vampire, but he defined the modern, iconic vampire when <i>Dracula</i> appeared in 1897. Since then, many have reinterpreted the ever-versatile vampire over and over again - and female writers have played vital roles in proving that the vampire, as well as our perpetual fascination with it, is truly immortal. These authors have devised some of the most fascinating, popular, and entertaining of our many vampiric variations: suavely sensual...fascinating but fatal...sexy and smart...undead but prone to detection...tormented or terrifying...amusing or amoral...doomed or deadly...badass and beautiful...cutting-edge or classic.... <i>Blood Sisters</i> collects a wide range of fantastical stories from <i>New York Times</i> best sellers Holly Black, Nancy Holder, Catherynne M. Valente, and Carrie Vaughn and critically acclaimed writers Chelsea Quinn Yarbro and Tanith Lee, all of whom have left their indelible and unique stamps on the vampire genre. Whether they are undeniably heroes and heroines or bloodthirsty monsters (or something in between), the undead are a lively lot. This anthology offers some of the best short fiction ever written by the \"blood sisters\" who know them best: stories you can really sink your teeth into. </p>";

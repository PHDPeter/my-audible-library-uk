window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Enormity</i> is the strange tale of an American working in Korea, a lonely young man named Manny Lopes, who is not only physically small (in his own words, he's a \"Creole shrimp\"), but his work, his failed marriage, and his race all conspire to make him feel puny and insignificant - the proverbial 98-pound weakling. </p><p>Then one day an accident happens, a quantum explosion, and suddenly Manny awakens to discover that he is big - really big. In fact, Manny is enormous: a mile-high colossus! </p><p>Now there's no stopping him: He's a one-man weapon of mass destruction. Yet he means well. </p><p><i>Enormity</i> takes some odd turns, featuring characters like surfing gangbangers, elderly terrorists, and a North Korean assassin who thinks she's Dorothy from <i>The Wizard of Oz.</i> There's also sex, violence, and action galore, as Manny battles the forces that seek to seduce or destroy him. </p><p>Who will survive? Who will be annihilated? Listen to <i>Enormity</i> and find out!</p>";

In this savagely reshaped world ruled by brigands and war makers, a rider seeks a lost city. Pursuing a dream to calm the violence in his soul, Jon Shannow, the brigand slayer, desires only peace. But from the Plague Lands emerges a fresh terror. </p> <p>The Lord of the Pit and his hell-born army seek to plunge mankind into a new demonic era. Seemingly invincible, they make a fatal mistake: they take Shannow's woman for blood sacrifice. And find themselves facing the deadliest warrior of the new age: Jon Shannow - the Jerusalem Man. </p>";

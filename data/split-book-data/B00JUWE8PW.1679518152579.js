window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>With an introduction by Sarah Brown</b> </p> <p>Women are standing up and #shoutingback. In a culture that's driven by social media, for the first time women are using this online space (@EverydaySexism, www.everydaysexism.com) to come together, share their stories, and encourage a new generation to recognise the problems that women face. </p> <p>This book is a call to arms in a new wave of feminism and it proves sexism is endemic - socially, politically, and economically. But women won't stand for it. The Everyday Sexism Project is grounded in reality; packed with substance, validity, and integrity and it shows that women will no longer tolerate a society that ignores the dangers and endless effects of sexism. </p> <p>In 2012 after being sexually harassed on London public transport Laura Bates, a young journalist, started a project called Everyday Sexism to collect stories for a piece she was writing on the issue. Astounded by the response she received and the wide range of stories that came pouring in from all over the world, she quickly realised that the situation was far worse than she'd initially thought. Enough was enough. From being leered at and wolf-whistled on the street, to aggravation in the work place and serious sexual assault, it was clear that sexism had been normalised. Bates decided it was time for change. </p> <p>This bold, jaunty, and ultimately intelligent book is the first to give a collective voice to the protest against sexism. This game-changing book is a juggernaut of stories, often shocking, sometimes amusing, and always poignant - it is a must-listen for every inquisitive, no-nonsense modern woman. Welcome to the fourth wave of feminism.</p>";

window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>He was a survivor - a wanderer who traded tales for food and shelter in the dark and savage aftermath of a devastating war.</p> <p>Fate touches him one chill winter’s day when he borrows the jacket of a long-dead postal worker to protect himself from the cold. The old, worn uniform still has power as a symbol of hope, and with it he begins to weave his greatest tale, of a nation on the road to recovery.</p> <p>This is the story of a lie that became the most powerful kind of truth. A timeless novel as urgently compelling as <i>War Day </i>or <i>Alas, Babylon</i>, David Brin’s <i>The Postman</i> is the dramatically moving saga of a man who rekindled the spirit of America through the power of a dream, from a modern master of science fiction.&nbsp;</p>";

window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Audible are delighted to present <i>Sleeping Beauty</i>, a unique listening experience for all the family to enjoy over the Christmas season. This exclusive new audio drama has been created in collaboration with the London Symphony Orchestra and is inspired by Tchaikovsky's beloved ballet music. Marty Ross’s reimagining of the famous fairy story draws on the worlds of folktale and the Brothers Grimm, while the LSO's specially-commissioned new recording, conducted by Gavin Sutherland, weaves through the drama like a rich and majestic film score.</p> <p>Lacking a legitimate heir, King Lothar (Stephen Fry) brings home a baby girl, Aurora (Phoebe Dynevor). His wife, Queen Ishbel, agrees to raise the child as her own and Princess Aurora grows up to become a beautiful, beloved and free-spirited young woman. But a shadow hangs over the kingdom. Devastated at her loss, Aurora’s mother Cara (Rochenda Sandall) takes her revenge by casting a terrible curse upon the princess and despite her sister Lila's efforts, the spell proves too powerful to break completely. Instead, when the fatal hour arrives, the whole Kingdom falls into an enchanted slumber, until Aurora's true love, Peter, a woodcutter's son (Adam Hugill), sets out on a perilous quest to rescue her.</p> <p>Also starring: David Ahmad, Karen Bartke, Samantha Beart, Raghad Chaar, Amy Darton, Alyssa Kyria, David Holt, Simon Kane, Harry Myers and Kenton Thomas.</p>";

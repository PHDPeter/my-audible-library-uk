window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>You SLUG the guy.</p> <p>You KISS the dame.&nbsp;</p> <p>You TOTAL the car.</p> <p>That's movies. And I love 'em.</p> <p>Gordy LaSure's passionate about film. He eats film, he drinks film, and sometimes he'll even watch a film. But most of all, he loves talking about film, and how they'd be a shit-ton better if only people would pull their asses out of their ears and listen to Gordy LaSure.</p> <p>The voyage of this audiobook can be categorised as an attempt to understand How In Hell Film Works. Why are some films bad and some films terrible? How come just a handful of films (<i>Titanic</i>, <i>Porky's</i>, <i>Dirty Harry</i>) are any good at all? Gordy'll tell you How and Why, and he'll give you a shot of Wherefore on the side. And he doesn't shoot from the hip; he shoots from the gut.</p>";

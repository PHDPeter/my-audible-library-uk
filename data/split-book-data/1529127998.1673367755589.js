window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Mark Gatiss stars as sinister raconteur, the Man in Black, in these 20 terrifying full-cast radio dramas.</p> <p>The Man in Black is waiting to make your acquaintance. Maybe you’ll meet him on a bus, in the supermarket or at an airport luggage carousel. Perhaps he’ll peer into your baby’s pram or approach you in the corridor of a care home. Wherever you encounter him, he's eager to pass on his stories. Stories of darkness and death, myth and madness. Stories to unsettle and horrify.</p> <p>Two lads on a council estate stumble onto a world where time has stopped. Something evil stalks stranded soldiers in Afghanistan. A retired accountant gets out of his depth on the Net. An ex-alcoholic is on the run from more than just his AA buddy. These tales and many more will haunt you long after the Man in Black has departed.</p> <p>Included are:&nbsp;</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>'The Tower' by Mike Walker&nbsp;</li> <li>'Project Purple' by Richard Vincent&nbsp;</li> <li>'The White Hare' by Lucy Gough&nbsp;</li> <li>'Hide and Seek' by Mike Cary&nbsp;</li> <li>'Bomber’s Moon' by Lucy Kirkwood</li> <li>'Phish Phood' by Kim Newman</li> <li>'Death Us Do Part' by Mike Bartlett</li> <li>'Flesh' by Tom Morton-Smith</li> <li>'Angels in Disguise' by Nicola Jones</li> <li>'The Old Road' by Penelope Skinner</li> <li>'Connect' by Lucy Moore</li> <li>'The Printed Name' by Nicholas Pierpan</li> <li>'Lights Out' by Christopher Golden and Amber Benson</li> <li>'Uncle William’s House' by Alison Falconer</li> <li>'Perfect Home' by Nick Warburton</li> <li>'Containment' by David Lemon</li> <li>'The Punt' by Christina Balit</li> <li>'The Beaten Track' by Dawn King</li> <li>'Reunion' by Janice Okoh&nbsp;</li> <li>'The New Boy' by Matthew Wilkie</li> </ul> <p>Among the cast are Tom Goodman-Hill, Mark Bonnar, Emerald O’Hanrahan, Vineeta Rishi Toby Jones, Adjoa Andoh, Jonathan Forbes, Nikki Amuka-Bird and Alex Lanipekun.</p>";

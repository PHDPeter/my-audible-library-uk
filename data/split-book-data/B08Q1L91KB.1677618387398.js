Across the water one night they can see homes burning and hear gunfire. Pup and her parents, with their goat and chickens and garden and their dog, Opey, have no contact with the mainland, except for boat runs into town. When their friends, two women biologists living on a tiny island two miles away, bring them news of the civil unrest up and down the coast and talk of secession, Pup’s father agrees to go into town with the women in their boat to check on things. It’s a fateful decision that will force Pup to make choices she could never have imagined, and that will alter the world for everyone.</p>";

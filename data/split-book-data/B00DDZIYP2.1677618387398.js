window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>What is it in Homer's <i>Odyssey</i> that has so enthralled readers from around the world for thousands of years? By joining Professor Vandiver for these 12 lectures on the <i>Odyssey</i>, you'll find out why. </p>This literary exploration centers on a single provocative question about the epic poem's protagonist, Odysseus: Why does he long so powerfully to go home? To probe the depths of this question, you'll embark on meticulous, insightful examinations of the most important episodes in the <i>Odyssey</i>. In doing so, you'll understand the cultural assumptions that lie behind Homer's lines and the critical and interpretive issues involved in truly unpacking this ancient masterpiece. <p></p> <p>Among the range of episodes, themes, and topics you'll explore are: Odysseus's superb skills as a rhetorician; the abrupt break in the text at the end of the \"Great Wanderings\" episode, when the poem briefly returns to the third-person narrative; Penelope's knowledge and motives as they relate to the inevitability of her suitors' doom; the effectiveness (or possible lack thereof) in the poem's ending; the historical basis for the Trojan War from which Odysseus returns; and more. </p> <p>For anyone who's loved the stories of Odysseus's encounters with witches, monsters, and vengeful gods; for anyone who's longed to truly grasp the intricate nature of Homer's epic; or for anyone who has been looking for ways to approach a work that can often be intimidating to first-time readers, these lectures are an invaluable resource and a helpful introduction to the grandest adventure story in Western literature.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying reference material will be available in your Library section along with the audio.</b></p>";

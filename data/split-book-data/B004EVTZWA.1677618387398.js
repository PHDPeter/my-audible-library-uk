window.bookSummaryJSON = "Jack Fleming was an investigative journalist in Prohibition-era Chicago until he got shot by an unknown assassin, bitten by his vampire girlfriend, and then became one of the undead. Now, this nice-guy nosferatu has a bunch of crazy vampire hunters on his trail, armed with crosses, silver bullets, and sharp wooden stakes. <p>He doesn't know how they found out about him or why they are \"out for his blood,\" but it's not a problem for this street-wise gumshoe, until someone starts shooting. Jack himself may be bulletproof, but his friends are not. And Jack is determined to get some answers, even if it kills him - again. It's a case of the living versus the undead. But who's hunting whom?</p>";
